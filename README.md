## About Me
Hi, I'm Ervel and I'm 20 years old. My one of the hobby is coding and I'm passionate about it. I have start coding with Electra Discord Bot since 2019. While I'm working on the bot, I taught myself JavaScript and honed my skills in this language. I also had opportunity to learn some Python and C# during my time in school.
